    title: 'Mercury',
    desc: " ⚫ Type: Rocky planet ⚫ Size (diameter): 4880 km, or about 38% the size of Earth ⚫ Mass:  3.301 × 1023 kg, or 1/20th the mass of Earth ⚫ Length of a year (orbital period): 88 days ⚫ Number of moons: 0 ⚫ Average distance from the Sun: 57.9 million km ⚫ Temperature: Between -173 and 427 degrees Celsius. ⚫ Formation: Like all the other planets, Mercury was likely formed in the large cloud of gas, dust and ice of the ancient solar system, which collapsed into a spinning disc. Our Sun was born at its centre, and the planets were created about 4.5 billion years ago from particles sticking together along rings in the disc. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, which likely influenced its composition and formation. The planet has a surprisingly large iron core, which may have formed because the early Sun heated and vaporized rock on Mercury's surface. ⚫ Orbit and rotation: Named after the Roman messenger of the gods, who was known for being very swift, Mercury takes only 88 days to complete one orbit around the Sun – the shortest year of all planets. Just like Earth, Mercury also rotates on its own axis, but much more slowly: one day-night cycle on Mercury takes the equivalent of 176 Earth days, or two full Mercurian years! Mercury’s rotation in relation to distant stars takes 59 Earth days. ⚫ Surface: At first glance Mercury looks a lot like Earth's Moon. Its surface is littered with craters that have accumulated and remained unchanged over billions of years, since the planet has no significant geological activity or atmosphere. Mercury's surface remains the most mysterious of all the rocky planets, though, as no lander has ever explored it. Some of Mercury's craters have shaded sections that are never exposed to the Sun. Scientists believe that frozen water may exist in these craters. ⚫ Exosphere: Mercury's atmosphere is so thin and fragile that it is instead considered an exosphere: a very thin volume of matter that surrounds a planet, but is not dense enough to behave like an atmosphere. For the most part, this outer layer is made up of particles coming from solar winds and elements from Mercury's crust (such as hydrogen, helium, oxygen and sodium) that are vaporized by the intense heat of the Sun. Mercury's exosphere is constantly evolving: while the solar wind continuously blows it away, intense gusts from the Sun also constantly super-heat more of the planet's crust, thereby replenishing Mercury's gassy envelope. Mercury's orbit is also the least circular of all the planets and looks somewhat egg-shaped. Because of this, the morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set, and continue rising again from certain spots on the surface of the small planet. The opposite effect happens at sunset, with the Sun setting and briefly rising before finally setting completely. ⚫ The exploration of Mercury: Mercury is the least-explored rocky planet in our solar system. Because it is so close to the Sun, sending probes to the small planet is difficult, as they would be attracted by the Sun's much stronger gravitational pull. NASA has sent two satellites to study Mercury: Mariner 10 in the 1970s and MESSENGER in the 2000s. It took many years and several complex orbits around other celestial bodies like Earth, Venus and the Sun for both satellites to execute fly-bys of Mercury close enough to observe the planet. These two missions revealed information about some of the planet's characteristics, such as its composition, magnetic field, exosphere, and surface geology. In 2018, the European Space Agency and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency launched the BepiColombo mission, which will reach Mercury in 2024. BepiColombo includes two satellites: the Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and the Mercury Magnetosphere Orbiter (MMO, also nicknamed \"Mio\"). MPO will take images of Mercury's surface and exosphere in different kinds of light, while Mio will study the hot planet's magnetic field.",

    title: 'Venus',
    desc: " ⚫ Type: Rocky planet ⚫ Size (diameter): 12,104 km, or 95% the size of Earth ⚫ Mass: 4.868 × 1024 kg, or 82% the mass of Earth ⚫ Length of a year (orbital period): 224.7 days ⚫ Number of moons: 0 ⚫ Average distance from the Sun: 108,208,000 km ⚫ Temperature: Approximately 460 degrees Celsius ⚫ Formation: Like all the other planets, Venus was likely formed in the large cloud of gas, dust, and ice of the ancient solar system, which collapsed into a spinning disc. Our Sun was born at its centre, and the planets were created about 4.5 billion years ago from particles sticking together along rings in the disc. Venus is the second closest planet to the Sun and is often called Earth's \"sister planet\" or \"twin planet.\" Venus and Earth have very similar sizes, masses, and compositions, but are otherwise quite different from each other. Scientists think that in the early days of the solar system, Venus may have been similar to present-day Earth and may even have had liquid water on its surface. ⚫ Orbit and rotation: Venus is the only planet that rotates clockwise; all the other planets rotate counter-clockwise. Venus's rotation is called retrograde rotation. One day on Venus – the time it takes the planet to complete a full rotation on its axis – is equal to 243 days on Earth. That is actually slower than the time it takes for Venus to complete one orbit around the Sun, which takes 225 Earth days. On Venus, as on Mercury, a year is actually shorter than a day! ⚫ Surface: Venus shows evidence of very strong volcanic activity and likely has more volcanoes than our planet. Scientists have never seen an active lava flow on Venus, but they estimate that 80% of the planet's surface is covered by smooth, volcanic plains that are left over from previous lava flows. Venus is entirely cloaked in thick clouds that hide its surface. In order to study it, scientists must use either spacecraft that land on the planet or radar technology on board satellites or probes. The clouds on Venus are filled with sulfuric acid (like the battery acid used in cars). This corrosive substance condenses in Venus's upper atmosphere and then falls as acid rain. But because Venus is so hot, it evaporates before reaching the surface ⚫ Temperature and atmosphere: Despite being only the second planet from the Sun, Venus (not Mercury) is the hottest planet in our solar system. Venus's high temperature is caused by its extremely thick atmosphere, which is over 90 times thicker than Earth's! This outer layer is composed almost entirely of carbon dioxide, a well-known gas responsible for a very strong greenhouse effect. Trapped by Venus's atmosphere, the Sun's energy heats the planet to constant temperatures over 450 degrees Celsius. ⚫ The exploration of Venus: The first exploration of Venus was done by the Soviet probe Venera 1. Launched in 1961, the spacecraft was supposed to fly by Venus to take a closer look at the planet. Unfortunately, the probe malfunctioned before it made its closest approach. Many other spacecraft were launched to study Venus, including several that landed on the planet's surface. The Soviet Venera program and the American Mariner and Pioneer campaigns of the 1960s and 1970s all allowed scientists to better understand the scorching planet, including its atmosphere, magnetic field, and geology. Due to the incredibly harsh conditions on Venus, and the crushing weight of its thick atmosphere, no lander has ever been able to survive there for longer than 127 minutes. Venus is often used to gravitationally assist spacecraft on their way to other destinations. For example, the Galileo spacecraft swung by Venus before heading out to Jupiter, its central target. During its brief observation of Venus, Galileo gathered data that hinted at the existence of lightning on the planet. More recent observations show that lightning is even more common on Venus than on Earth.",

    title: 'Earth',
    desc: " ⚫ Type: Rocky planet ⚫ Size (diameter): 12,742 km ⚫ Mass: 5.97 × 1024 kg ⚫ Length of a year (orbital period): 365.26 days ⚫ Number of moons: One: the Moon ⚫ Average distance from the Sun: 150 million km (1 a.u.) ⚫ Temperature: Between -89.2 to 56.7 degrees Celsius ⚫ Formation: Scientists believe it took between 10 and 20 million years for Earth to form. The solar system began as a large cloud of gas, dust, and ice that collapsed into a spinning disc. Our Sun was born at its centre, and the planets were created about 4.5 billion years ago from particles sticking together along rings in the disc. ⚫ Orbit and rotation: Earth completes one orbit around the Sun in 365.26 days. Since this is a little longer than a regular calendar year of 365 days, one extra day is added every four years; a year with 366 days is called a leap year. Earth also spins on its axis and completes one rotation per 24 hours. This rotation causes night and day. Earth's rotation and orbit are not perfectly perpendicular to each other – an angle of 23.5 degrees exists between the two. This tilt in Earth's rotation causes different parts of the planet's surface to receive varying intensities of sunlight throughout the year, causing the seasons. When the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it is summer in the North and winter in the South. When the southern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it is summer in the South and winter in the North. ⚫ Surface: Over two-thirds of Earth's surface is covered in water. The abundance of this important substance plays a crucial role in making Earth the only place in the entire universe that we know with absolute certainty harbours life. Like all other planets in the solar system, Earth has been subjected to thousands of asteroid impacts throughout its long history. However, the record of these impacts is not easy to find because Earth's surface is constantly changing: our planet's water systems, active plate tectonics, and atmosphere have eroded away key clues about these prehistoric collisions. Despite these forces, some traces are still visible across Canada, like the Manicouagan Crater in this photo taken by astronauts aboard the International Space Station. ⚫ Observation: The Canadian Space Agency (CSA), NASA and other space agencies around the world observe and study Earth from space. Satellites that orbit our planet, such as Canada's RADARSAT Constellation, have a privileged point of view that enables scientists to study ocean currents, climate change, weather patterns, and more.",

    title: 'Mars',
    desc: " ⚫ Type: Rocky planet ⚫ Size (diameter): 6791 km, or about half the size of Earth ⚫ Mass: 6.417 × 1023 kg, or about 10% the mass of Earth ⚫ Length of a year (orbital period): 687 days ⚫ Number of moons: Two: Phobos and Deimos ⚫ Average distance from the Sun: 227,939,200 km ⚫ Temperature: Between -140 and 30 degrees Celsius ⚫ Formation: Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system. Scientists believe that all of the planets were created just over 4.5 billion years ago. The solar system began as a large cloud of gas, dust, and ice, which collapsed into a spinning disc. The Sun was formed at its centre and particles began sticking together along rings in the disc – leading to the formation of the planets. ⚫ Orbit and rotation: A year on Mars – the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun – is nearly twice as long as a year on Earth. However, the planets rotate at a similar frequency: a day on Mars (known as a sol) lasts about 24 hours and 40 minutes in Earth time. Mars is tilted by about 25 degrees, which means that the red planet has four seasons, too – each twice as long as Earth's! ⚫ Surface: Mars is known as the \"red planet\" due to its reddish hue caused by oxidized iron (or rust) on the planet's surface. The tallest mountain in the entire solar system, Olympus Mons, is on Mars. This extinct volcano is nearly 22 km tall – roughly two and a half times the height of Mount Everest. Valles Marineris is a massive canyon system that stretches over 3,000 km across Mars's surface – about the distance between Montreal and Calgary! Plunging about 8 km deep, and often referred to as \"the Grand Canyon of Mars,\" Valles Marineris makes the red planet home to the largest known canyon in the solar system. The search for water on Mars dates back to the 1800s. In 1877, Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli observed a network of lines on the surface of Mars, which he called \"canali\" in Italian. The mistranslation as \"canals\" in English fuelled speculation about the possibility of both flowing water and intelligent life on Mars. Since then, planetary flyby missions, improved imaging techniques, and data collected by orbiters, landers, and rovers have given scientists a better understanding of the Martian landscape. Water ice was found on the north and south poles of Mars, much of it underneath glaciers of frozen carbon dioxide. However, a small amount of water exists in Mars's thin atmosphere: Canada's meteorological station on the Phoenix mission was the first to detect snow, which vaporized before it hit the ground ⚫ A rich past: Since liquid water cannot currently exist on the surface due to Mars's low atmospheric pressure, traces of ancient riverbeds and lakes imply that a vast quantity of liquid water may once have existed in the presence of a denser atmosphere. Mars also used to have a global magnetic field, but scientists believe the planet lost it about 4 billion years ago. Some evidence suggests that ancient Mars may have been similar to Earth, and may have harboured the right conditions for life. The Babylonians divided the week into seven days, each one in honour of a celestial body within our solar system: Sunday was named for the Sun, Monday, the Moon, Tuesday, Mars (more easily recognizable in the French word \"mardi\"), Wednesday, Mercury, Thursday, Jupiter, Friday, Venus and Saturday, Saturn. Because of its red appearance in the night sky, many ancient civilizations associated Mars with war. In English, the word \"Tuesday\" is derived from the Norse god Tyr, who is the equivalent of Mars, the Roman god of war. ⚫ Martian exploration: Many missions have been sent to explore Mars, but only 50% have been successful due to the significant challenges caused by the Martian atmosphere. Landing safely on Mars requires a creative combination of heat-shielding, rocket-powered descent, and parachutes. NASA's Viking 1 and Viking 2 spacecraft were the first to successfully land and explore the surface of Mars in 1975. These spacecraft were designed to search for signs of life on Mars. One of the greatest successes in planetary exploration was the Opportunity rover, which landed on Mars in 2004. It had a planned mission lifetime of only 90 days but ended up exploring the Martian surface for over 14 years. The rover travelled a record-breaking 45 km of the Martian surface and helped scientists better understand Mars's geology and climate. Opportunity's twin, the Spirit rover, also collected data for over 20 times longer than its planned mission. NASA's Curiosity rover, which is currently exploring Mars, has travelled over 20 km on the red planet's surface. Curiosity analyzes Martian soil with a Canadian-made geology instrument called APXS, led by Dr. Ralf Gellert (University of Guelph). To date, APXS has sent over 1500 scientific results back to Earth! The Canadian Space Agency (CSA) also funds Canadian scientists who are participating in other international Mars missions: Dr. Livio Tornabene (Western University) and Dr. Ed Cloutis (University of Winnipeg) are involved in the European Space Agency's ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, a satellite designed to study Martian atmosphere. The satellite also carries a Canadian-built communication antenna subsystem. Dr. Catherine Johnson and Anna Mittelholz from the University of British Columbia are part of NASA's InSight mission, which takes a closer look at the structure and composition of Mars's inner layers. Dr. Chris Herd from the University of Alberta is a participating scientist on the Mars 2020 mission, which includes a rover designed to collect and store samples for possible return to Earth. The future of Mars exploration will not only involve robots, but humans as well. With increased crew autonomy, the long-duration missions needed to reach the red planet will soon become reality. ⚫ Going to Mars: a complex endeavour: Sending crewed missions to the red planet is a long-term goal of international space agencies. However, a number of important factors must be taken into account when planning a mission: Launch windows: Because of the massive amount of energy needed to launch an interplanetary journey, space engineers must carefully calculate the most efficient path. The orbits of Earth and Mars create launch windows every 26 months. A tricky place to land: Entering the Martian atmosphere – and slowing down a descent module at the right speed and angle to ensure a successful landing – is no easy feat. Communications delay: Depending on the distance between Earth and Mars, commands sent to the red planet take almost 20 minutes to arrive, and another 20 minutes for a response to travel back to Earth. And other challenges: With current technology, a journey to Mars would take at least two years. A crew travelling to the red planet would face unprecedented isolation and high levels of radiation. They would need to be highly independent from Earth and would have to grow their own food to stay healthy in space. For over 15 years, a persistent falsehood has resurfaced on the Internet almost every summer. The rumour alleges that on the night of August 27, Mars will appear to be as large as the full Moon, a once-in-a-lifetime event that will not happen again until the year 2287. This hoax may have arisen in part because Mars appeared to be larger than usual on August 27, 2003, when it made its closest approach to Earth in 60,000 years. However, because of the great distance between Earth and Mars, the red planet cannot possibly appear to be as big as the Moon, even when it is magnified by a telescope.",

    title: 'Jupiter',
    desc: " ⚫ Type: Gas giant ⚫ Size (diameter): 139,822 km, or about 11 Earths ⚫ Mass: 1.9 × 1027 kg, or 318 Earths ⚫ Length of a year (orbital period): 11.8 years ⚫ Number of moons: 79 ⚫ Average distance from the Sun: 778.6 million km ⚫ Temperature: Between -161 and -108 degrees Celsius ⚫ Formation: Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and also the largest in our solar system. Like all the other planets, it was likely formed in a massive, ancient cloud of gas, dust, and ice that collapsed into a spinning disc. Our Sun was born at its centre, and the planets were created about 4.5 billion years ago from particles sticking together along rings in the disc. Scientists believe that many rocky planets larger than Earth existed in the early inner solar system. Physical forces moved Jupiter closer to the Sun and destroyed these other planets, allowing the formation of the current rocky planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars) before pushing Jupiter back outwards to its current position. Jupiter has at least 79 known moons, which were drawn by the massive planet's strong gravitational pull. Fifty-three of them have names, while 26 are not yet named. ⚫ Orbit: Jupiter has the shortest day of any planet in the solar system: it completes a full rotation on itself in less than 10 hours. Because of its very fast rotation, Jupiter is noticeably flattened at its poles and bulges around its centre. Although Jupiter's days are short, its years are long – the planet completes an orbit of the Sun in just under 12 Earth years. ⚫ Atmosphere and surface: Since Jupiter and Saturn are mainly composed of gases instead of solid elements, it can be tricky to determine where their atmosphere ends and their surface begins. However, the surface is defined as the layer with atmospheric pressure equal to that at sea level on Earth. Jupiter's atmosphere is very thick and is mostly composed of molecular hydrogen, helium and methane. Cloud layers and swirling storms can be seen clearly in its atmosphere, even with amateur telescopes. One storm, known as the Great Red Spot, has been observed by astronomers for centuries. It is several times bigger than Earth and appears to be shrinking. Scientists believe Jupiter may have a small rocky core that could be about the size of Earth, but this has not yet been proven. ⚫ Galilean moons: The famous Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei studied Jupiter extensively in the 1600s and discovered its four largest moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. These moons are unique and of great interest to scientists: Io is the most volcanically active body in the entire solar system. Europa is an ocean world covered by a thick crust of ice. It is one of the best candidates for finding extraterrestrial life in our solar system. Ganymede is huge – it's even larger than the planet Mercury – and is the only moon known to have its own magnetic field. Callisto has the oldest and most heavily cratered surface in the solar system, which acts as a great time capsule for the history of the solar system. Galileo's observation that these moons orbit Jupiter provided evidence against the previously held belief that all bodies in the solar system orbit Earth. Today, we know that the reverse is true. If the Galilean moons orbited the Sun, they would be large enough to qualify as dwarf planets. ⚫ Exploring Jupiter: The first spacecraft to orbit the solar system's biggest planet was NASA's Galileo in 1995. The probe collected data about Jupiter for over seven years, which helped astronomers study several of its moons and better understand the planet's atmosphere. Galileo even observed a comet crashing into Jupiter's atmosphere in 1994. NASA's Juno spacecraft was launched to Jupiter in 2011 and arrived in a polar orbit around the planet in 2016. While passing over the planet's north and south poles, the mission has returned breathtaking images of Jupiter from a new point of view and allowed scientists to learn more about the massive planet's composition and gravitational and magnetic fields. Both the European Space Agency and NASA are designing proposed missions that might visit Jupiter's moons in the next decade to find out if they hold liquid oceans—and maybe even life.",

    title: 'Saturn',
    desc: " ⚫ Type: Gas giant ⚫ Size (diameter): 116,464 km, or about 9 Earths ⚫ Mass: 5.68 × 1026 kg, or 95 Earths ⚫ Length of a year (orbital period): 29.5 years ⚫ Number of moons: 146 ⚫ Average distance from the Sun: 1.43 billion km ⚫ Temperature: Between -189 and -139 degrees Celsius ⚫ Formation: Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in our solar system. Like all the other planets, Saturn was likely formed in the large cloud of gas, dust, and ice which collapsed into a spinning disc. Our Sun was born at its centre, and the planets were created about 4.5 billion years ago from particles sticking together along rings in the disc. Saturn is best known for its impressive rings, which are about 20 metres thick on average. Some scientists believe that the planet's icy rings are made of material left over from a massive collision between the young planet and one of its early moons. ⚫ Orbit: Saturn has a very short day. The planet takes about 10.5 hours to complete a full rotation on its axis. It takes Saturn about 29.5 Earth years to complete a full orbit around the Sun. ⚫ Atmosphere and surface: Since gas giant planets like Saturn and Jupiter are mainly composed of gases instead of solid elements, it can be tricky to determine where their atmosphere ends and their surface begins. However, the surface is defined as the layer with atmospheric pressure equal to that at sea level on Earth. There is some debate about the conditions within the planet's atmosphere. For example, some scientists argue that lightning storms in the upper layers even cause it to rain diamonds on Saturn! ⚫ Composition: Scientists believe Saturn may contain an extremely hot, small solid core made up of iron and nickel, surrounded by several layers of hydrogen and helium in different phases. The intense pressure and heat within Saturn are so great that these gases are compressed into liquids and metals. Saturn is the only planet with a density lower than water. That means that if you were to find a large enough bathtub to put Saturn in, the massive planet would float! ⚫ Moons and rings: Saturn has an abundance of moons. For example, much like Jupiter's Europa, Saturn's moon Enceladus is covered with an icy crust, under which lies an ocean that could harbour extraterrestrial life. Enceladus is also covered with a unique geological feature: ice volcanoes that spew out water vapour instead of lava! Another of Saturn's natural satellites, Titan, is larger than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the solar system with its own atmosphere. In addition to large named moons, anywhere from dozens to hundreds of smaller unnamed bodies called moonlets are embedded inside Saturn's ring system. Saturn's ring system is the most complex in the solar system: The rings are not solid: each one is made up of 90% to 95% water ice. Each ring contains small particles that can range in size from a speck of dust to a 10-metre-wide snowball! The entire system stretches up to 282,000 kilometres from the planet. Each ring orbits the planet at a different speed. ⚫ Exploring Saturn: Although Saturn was observed by the Pioneer 11 and Voyager probes on their way to more distant destinations, the gas giant was the main target of the historic Cassini mission. Cassini was launched in 1997 and arrived in orbit around Saturn in 2004. During its 13-year mission (over three times its planned length), Cassini discovered and imaged new moons orbiting Saturn and collected data about the planet's clouds and ring system. Cassini also carried a probe named Huygens, which landed on Saturn's moon Titan in 2005. Huygens took hundreds of pictures and took many measurements of Titan's atmosphere and surface, whose soil is covered with rocky or icy pebbles. The probe also helped scientists discover Titan's orange, hazy atmosphere and the existence of large lakes filled with substances called hydrocarbons (similar to the fuel that powers cars). The Cassini mission came to an end in 2017 when scientists sent the spacecraft in a controlled fall into Saturn's atmosphere, where it burned up. This was done to prevent the spacecraft from contaminating any of Saturn's moons, which might be environments for life themselves.",

    title: 'Uranus',
    desc: " ⚫ Type: Ice giant ⚫ Size (diameter): 50,724 km, or about 4 Earths ⚫ Mass: 8.7 × 1025 kg, or about 15 Earths ⚫ Length of a year (orbital period): 84 years ⚫ Number of moons: 27 ⚫ Average distance from the Sun: 2.9 billion km ⚫ Temperature: Between -226 and -197 degrees Celsius ⚫ Formation: Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and is considered an ice giant because it is largely made up of water, ammonia, and methane in solid form. Like all the other planets, Uranus was likely formed in a massive, ancient cloud of gas, dust, and ice that collapsed into a spinning disc. Our Sun was born at its centre, and the planets were created about 4.5 billion years ago from particles sticking together along rings in the disc. Scientists believe the differences between ice giants and gas giants (like Saturn and Jupiter) are due to their slightly different formation histories. Except for Earth, the names of all the planets in our solar system are derived from gods of Roman and Greek mythology: Mercury is the fastest planet, and is named after Hermes, the swift messenger of the gods in the Greek tradition. Jupiter is named after the Roman ruler of the gods, commonly known as Zeus in Greek mythology. Uranus is named after the Greek god of the sky, who was also Zeus's grandfather. Moons are often given names related to that of their planet. Mars's moons, Phobos and Deimos, \"Fear\" and \"Terror,\" were the twin sons of the god of war. Uniquely, many of Uranus's moons bear the names of characters from English literature. ⚫ Rotation, orbit, and tilt: A day on Uranus lasts about 17 hours. Interestingly, different parts of Uranus rotate at different speeds: while the interior of the planet spins in that time, its upper atmosphere completes a full rotation three hours faster, which creates some of the most violent winds in the solar system. Near Uranus's poles, they blow in the same direction as the rotation of the planet. Closer to the equator, the winds blow in the opposite direction! Uranus takes 84 years to complete one full orbit around the Sun. Instead of rotating vertically like all of the other planets, Uranus spins around a horizontal axis. Scientists believe that an Earth-sized planet may have collided with Uranus and knocked it on its side. Uranus's dramatic 98-degree tilt gives rise to the most extreme seasons in the solar system. For nearly 21 years, a quarter of the Uranian year, one pole is bathed in sunlight while the other exists in complete darkness. For the next 21 years, both poles receive similar amounts of sunlight as they gradually switch places and the cycle repeats. ⚫ Atmosphere and surface: Like the other giant planets in our solar system, Uranus does not have a solid surface. Scientists believe that the interior is made up of a solid rocky core covered by a dense liquid layer of water and ammonia. The atmosphere surrounding the interior of the planet is mostly hydrogen and helium. Despite having the second fastest winds in the solar system (after Neptune), Uranus's atmosphere looks quite calm. Very few clouds are observed in its light blue atmosphere. ⚫ Rings: Although Saturn is best known for its elaborate ring system, all of the giant planets in our solar system have rings of their own. Uranus has 13 distinct rings made up of very dark particles, quite different from Saturn's rings, which are mostly water ice. Scientists believe that Uranus's rings formed after the planet took shape, from the leftovers of destroyed moons. The rings are tilted about 90 degrees and match Uranus's rotation. ⚫ Exploration of Uranus: Launched in 1977 to explore the outer solar system, NASA's Voyager 2 was the only spacecraft to fly relatively close to Uranus. It surveyed the planet from a distance of about 80,000 km in 1986 before moving on to the neighbouring ice giant, Neptune. During its short observation of Uranus, the probe studied the planet's atmosphere, magnetic field, ring system and many of its moons. The spacecraft's observations even helped scientists discover 10 of the planet's natural satellites.",

    title: 'Neptune',
    desc: " ⚫ Type: Ice giant ⚫ Size (diameter): 49,244 km, or about 4 Earths Mass  1.0 × 1026 kg, or about 17 Earths ⚫ Length of a year (orbital period): 165 years ⚫ Number of moons: 14 ⚫ Average distance from the Sun: 4.5 billion km ⚫ Temperature: Between -218 and -200 degrees Celsius ⚫ Formation: The eighth planet from the Sun, Neptune is considered an ice giant because it is largely made up of water, ammonia, and methane in solid form. As our solar system took shape about 4.5 billion years ago, Neptune was likely formed in a massive, ancient cloud of gas, dust, and ice which collapsed into a spinning disc with our Sun at its centre. Scientists believe the differences between ice giants and gas giants (like Saturn and Jupiter) are due to their slightly different formation histories. ⚫ Rotation and orbit: Based on measurements taken by the Voyager 2 probe, different parts of Neptune may rotate at different speeds since the planet is not a solid body. Neptune's equator seems to rotate once every 18 hours while its polar regions spin once every 12 hours. This difference in rotational speed between the different regions is the largest of any planet and causes the strongest winds in the solar system, as fast as 2100 km/h! Neptune takes 165 years to complete one full orbit around the Sun. After about 75 years of being a planet, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. Neptune therefore regained its status as the outermost planet in the solar system. ⚫ Atmosphere and surface: Like the other giant planets in our solar system, Neptune does not have a solid surface. Scientists believe that the interior of the planet is made up of a solid rocky core covered by a hot and dense liquid layer of water and ammonia. The atmosphere surrounding the interior of the planet is made up of mostly hydrogen and helium. Neptune's blue colour is caused by the methane found in its atmosphere, which absorbs red light. Scientists are unsure why Uranus and Neptune are different shades of blue despite their very similar atmospheres. Like that of Jupiter, Neptune's atmosphere contains many storm systems including the Great Dark Spot, which is about as wide as Earth. When astronomers in the 19th century first studied the orbit of Uranus, they observed that the planet's path around the Sun differed from their expectations in a way that suggested it was being acted upon by other forces. They suspected that the variation might be caused by the existence of an unknown planet beyond Uranus. Using complex calculations, two different astronomers independently predicted the location of this new planet, Neptune, in the sky – and in 1846, it was found at almost that exact spot! Although it had been observed beforehand, Neptune is the only planet to have been discovered through mathematical calculation. ⚫ Exploration of Neptune: Launched in 1977 to explore the outer solar system, NASA's Voyager 2 was the only spacecraft to fly by Neptune. It observed Neptune from a distance of about 4400 km in 1989 after having studied Uranus. The probe gathered information on Neptune's magnetic field, atmosphere, and several of the planet's moons. Voyager 2 also discovered Neptune's Great Dark Spot.",

    title: 'Pluto',
    desc: "When Pluto was discovered in 1930, it was called the ninth planet in our solar system, but its status as a fully fledged planet came into question in the 1990s. Pluto was officially reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. The best-known dwarf planet, Pluto is also the largest in size and the second largest in mass. Pluto has five moons. The largest, Charon, is over half the size of its host. Pluto's orbit is not circular like those of the other planets and it actually crosses Neptune's orbit, which means that Pluto is sometimes closer to the Sun than Neptune is. It takes Pluto nearly 250 years to complete one trip around the Sun. Not much was known about Pluto before NASA's New Horizons mission. Launched in 2006, the spacecraft took nearly nine years to reach its target. The mission revealed that Pluto's surface features plains and mountains made of nitrogen ice and water ice.",

    desc: "Located beyond the orbit of Neptune, Eris completes one trip around the Sun every 557 years. It is slightly smaller than Pluto but actually contains over 25% more matter. The discovery of this denser dwarf planet in 2005 may have been the turning point that forced astronomers to reconsider Pluto's classification as a planet. To illustrate this disruption, Eris was named after the Greek goddess of discord. Since Eris is so far away, no surface details can be seen with current instruments, but astronomers have detected the presence of methane ice and believe Eris's surface is similar to that of Pluto.",

    title: 'Ceres',
    desc: "Ceres is the largest object in the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. This dwarf planet alone contains about a third of all the matter found in the belt! Its near-spherical shape means that this rocky, icy body is not considered an asteroid. While most dwarf planets orbit the Sun at the very outer edges of our solar system, Ceres is the only one located inside the orbit of Neptune. It takes Ceres 4.6 years to complete one trip around the Sun. Scientists suspect that this unique dwarf planet may even have an ocean of liquid water hidden under a layer of ice. NASA's Dawn spacecraft was launched in 2007 and entered into orbit around Ceres after first observing nearby asteroid Vesta. Dawn allowed astronomers to see detailed images of the dwarf planet for the first time and find out more about its composition and surface.",

It is located in the Kuiper Belt, a ring of icy debris beyond the orbit of Neptune – around 30 to 50 times farther from the Sun than Earth is. Astronomers say that Makemake is likely reddish in colour, similar to Pluto. In 2015, a moon nicknamed MK2 was discovered orbiting the dwarf planet. Makemake takes over 300 years to complete a trip around the Sun. Makemake was named after a creator god from the myths of the Rapa Nui, the native people of Easter Island.',

Astronomers believe that this fast rotation has deformed Haumea into an ellipsoid (egg-shaped). This dwarf planet has two moons: Hi'iaka and Namaka. It may even be the only Kuiper Belt object to have its own ring. Haumea shares its name with the Hawaiian goddess of fertility and childbirth, and the dwarf planet's moons are named after her offspring.",

    title: 'Sun',
    desc: " ⚫ Type: Star ⚫ Size (diameter): 1.4 million km, or about 110 Earths ⚫ Mass: 2.0 × 1030 kg, or about 333,000 Earths ⚫ Orbital period: 250 million years ⚫ Orbits around: The centre of the Milky Way ⚫ Number of planets: 8 ⚫ Average distance from the centre of the Milky Way: 2.7 × 1017 km, or 27,200 light-years ⚫ Temperature: About 5500 degrees Celsius on its surface ⚫ Life cycle: The Sun and the solar system were formed about 4.5 billion years ago when a giant cloud of gas and dust collapsed on itself. Since then, the Sun has continued to burn its fuel, hydrogen gas, and release particles and radiation (including light and heat!) out into the solar system. In about five billion years, the Sun will run out of fuel and will swell up into a red giant star. It will become so large that it will swallow up Mercury and Venus – and possibly even Earth. Later on, the Sun will shed its outer envelope and leave behind a white dwarf, surrounded by an outer shell of gas. These glowing remains of Sun-like stars are called planetary nebulae. Distances between objects in space can be huge, so scientists have created new units to help express measurements on an enormous scale. Because all light travels at a constant speed of about 300,000 kilometres per second, it can be used to measure a light-year: the distance that light travels in one Earth year. That's about 9.5 trillion kilometres! The Sun is only about 150 million kilometres, or eight light-minutes, away from Earth. Because the Sun is our closest and most well-understood star, astronomers use its characteristics as a reference when they study other stars. For example, the mass of gigantic celestial objects like black holes or galaxies is expressed in solar masses. The supermassive black hole at the centre of our galaxy is equivalent to about 4 million solar masses, and the Milky Way itself contains about the same mass as 1 trillion Suns – a thousand billion solar masses! ⚫ Orbit and rotation: The Sun orbits the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way. It takes the Sun about 250 million years to complete one full orbit. Like the planets, it also rotates on its own axis. It takes a little over 25 days for the Sun to complete a full rotation. ⚫ Structure: The Sun is made up of several layers that each have different characteristics. The core: is the innermost part of the Sun has a temperature of over 15 million degrees Celsius is where nuclear fusion produces all of the Sun's energy. Energy from the core is transported outward through two layers called the radiative and convective zones. The surface of the Sun has a temperature of about 5500 degrees Celsius. The outermost region of the Sun's atmosphere, the corona, can be hotter than the Sun's core. The corona can reach a scorching 20 million degrees Celsius, and scientists are still not sure why it is so incredibly hot. This outer layer can be seen during total solar eclipses. ⚫ Space weather: The Sun's activity can have a significant impact on our daily lives. Powerful bursts, flares, and sudden increases in brightness can launch particles and radiation throughout the solar system. Solar storms are often associated with the beautiful aurora, as particles released by the Sun interact with Earth's magnetic field. But these unpredictable events can also be dangerous – solar storms can trigger power outages, satellite malfunctions, and even disruptions to GPS and communications systems. The intensity of these storms is sometimes influenced by the Sun's seasons: our closest star goes through a cycle of minimum and maximum activity that lasts roughly 11 years. With each cycle, the Sun's north and south poles trade places. Scientists study the Sun, in part, to try to mitigate the negative effects of solar storms here on Earth. Canada is contributing an ultraviolet imaging instrument to SMILE, a international satellite mission designed to study the chain of events that drives space weather. ⚫ Solar observation: Astronomers – amateur and professional alike – must use specialized equipment to observe the Sun because it is so incredibly bright. Scientists have studied the Sun using space probes since the 1950s. NASA's Pioneer probes measured the Sun's winds and magnetic field. Launched in 1995, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, built by NASA and the European Space Agency, provided constant direct observations of the Sun until 2012. It continues to monitor the Sun at many different wavelengths. NASA's Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 to study the Sun while in orbit around our star. As the probe makes its closest approaches to the Sun in late 2024, it will achieve speeds of up to 200 km per second, making it the fastest artificial object. During its mission, the probe will graze the Sun's outer corona at a relatively close distance, only 7 million kilometres away! This flyby should help scientists solve the mystery of why the corona is much hotter than the surface. Parker will also study the Sun's magnetic field and collect data about energy and particles associated with solar winds.",

    title: 'Moon',
    desc: " ⚫ Size (diameter): 3476 km, or about 1/4 the size of Earth ⚫ Mass: 7.347 × 1022 kg, or 1/81 the mass of Earth ⚫ Length of a year (orbital period): 27.3 days ⚫ Average distance from the Earth: 384,400 km ⚫ Temperature: Between -248 and 123 degrees Celsius ⚫ Formation: The Moon is a rocky body that orbits planet Earth. It likely formed when a very large (Mars-sized) asteroid struck Earth 4.5 billion years ago, very early in our planet's history. The debris from the impact clumped together to form our natural satellite, the Moon. This shared formation explains why Earth and the Moon are made up of many of the same elements. ⚫ Orbit and rotation: The Moon is tidally locked with Earth, which means that its rotation on its axis and its orbit around Earth are perfectly synchronized, causing the same side of the Moon to always be facing Earth. ⚫ Surface: The surface of the Moon is littered with craters caused by asteroid impacts that have occurred over billions of years. Because the Moon does not have much of an atmosphere, or any liquid water or vegetation, lunar craters do not erode over time and their appearance does not change. This means that the Moon is like a cosmic time capsule. By studying it, scientists can learn more about the history of the entire solar system. ⚫ Eclipses: The Moon does not produce its own visible light. Instead, it acts like a mirror that reflects sunlight. Depending on the alignment of the Moon, Earth and the Sun, Earth can cast a shadow on the Moon, making it appear dimmer. This is called a lunar eclipse. Some sunlight can still stream through Earth's atmosphere during a total eclipse. The Moon appears red during an eclipse because of the way sunlight passes through Earth's atmosphere (which scatters blue light and lets red pass through more easily). ⚫ Lunar exploration: Other than Earth, the Moon is the most explored celestial body in our solar system. The first artificial object sent to the Moon was a Soviet probe called Luna 2, which crashed onto the Moon's surface on September 14, 1959. A \"space race\" between the United States of America and the Soviet Union ensued in the following decade, culminating in the landing of two American astronauts, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, on the Moon on July 20, 1969. Between 1969 and 1972, 12 men walked on the Moon as part of the Apollo program. Since then, many other countries have either put satellites into orbit around the Moon or sent landers and rovers to study its surface. Several lunar missions have even brought Moon rocks back to Earth for scientists to study. An advanced version of an antenna originally designed for Canada's first satellite Alouette-I was used on the Apollo spacecraft. A Canadian company, Héroux-Devtek, built the landing gear of the Apollo lunar module. Ontario engineer Owen Maynard played a key role in the planning and design of the Apollo lunar landing module, the Eagle. He and dozens of Canadian engineers and scientists worked at NASA on many aspects of the Apollo missions, from spacecraft design to mission planning. Canadian flight surgeon Dr. Bill Carpentier looked after Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin. ⚫ Canada's role in future Moon exploration: Canada is joining the NASA-led effort to return to the Moon – to stay. Known as the Artemis program, this exciting next chapter of Moon exploration includes plans for a small space station known as the Lunar Gateway. Building on a legacy of leadership in space robotics, Canada is contributing Canadarm3, a smart robotic system that will help maintain the Gateway, capture visiting vehicles, and enable cutting-edge science. The Canadian Space Agency's (CSA) Lunar Exploration Accelerator Program (LEAP) is designed to prepare Canada's space sector for lunar exploration by offering a wide range of opportunities for Canadian science and technology activities in lunar orbit, on the surface of the Moon, and beyond. In return for contributing Canadarm3, a smart robotic system, to the Lunar Gateway, Canada receives a range of opportunities for lunar science, technology demonstration and commercial activities, as well as two astronaut flights to the Moon. CSA astronaut Jeremy Hansen will be part of Artemis II, the first crewed mission to the Moon since 1972.",

    title: 'Asteroid Bennu',
    desc: "⚫ Size: Approximately 500 m across ⚫ Bennuvian day: 4.3 hours ⚫ Bennuvian year: 436 Earth days ⚫ Average speed: Approximately 101,400 km/h. Asteroid Bennu was the target of the OSIRIS-REx mission, which collected a sample and sent it back to Earth for analysis. With over half a million known asteroids to choose from, why did scientists set their sights on Bennu? Its location, size, composition, and scientific importance made Bennu the best place to send the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft on its cosmic journey. ⚫ Location: Bennu's proximity to Earth makes it easier to reach. While most asteroids in our solar system are located between Mars and Jupiter, Bennu is part of a smaller group known as near-Earth asteroids (NEAs). These objects travel within 50 million kilometres of our planet's path. During its 436-day journey around the Sun, Bennu moves in an elliptical pattern that overlaps with Earth's orbit every six years. The OSIRIS-REx sample-return mission was designed to take advantage of Bennu's closest proximity to Earth to reduce risk and cost. OSIRIS-REx is allowing scientists to learn more about how Bennu and other NEAs act as they orbit the Sun. ⚫ Size and composition: Asteroids with smaller diameters rotate more quickly than those with large diameters. When selecting an ideal asteroid for the OSIRIS-REx mission, researchers needed their target to be wider than 200 metres to ensure that the spacecraft could safely approach to collect loose material from the asteroid's surface. Studies from Earth revealed that Bennu is a rare carbon-rich asteroid. Bennu is quite dark, reflecting only 4.5% of the light that hits it. This means that Bennu absorbs much of the Sun's light as heat energy, which, when released, could change its course. Scientists want to learn more about how an asteroid's path might be affected by its composition, colour, and reflectivity. By carefully mapping Bennu's surface, Canadian laser instrument OLA gave scientists a much better idea of the asteroid's size and shape. The building blocks of life? Bennu is an especially exciting target because it has remained mostly unchanged since the formation of the solar system, 4.6 billion years ago. Scientists can study this cosmic time capsule to learn more about our distant past. Some researchers believe that the building blocks of life on Earth may have been delivered from space by asteroids. Bennu's rocky surface could include clay minerals and rock structures known to contain water. Instruments on board OSIRIS-REx might even detect the presence of organic molecules like sugars or amino acids. These chemical beginnings of protein and are essential to all forms of life on Earth. Finding organics on an asteroid could support the idea that the chemistry needed for life first emerged far from our planet, and was brought here by meteorite impacts long ago. In 2013, Bennu was named by Michael Puzio, a nine-year-old student from North Carolina, USA. The third grader won an international contest to give the asteroid, previously known as near-Earth object 101955 (1999 RQ36), a friendlier name. Michael suggested \"Bennu\" because he imagined that the robotic sampling arm and solar panels of the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft looked like the neck and wings of Bennu, the Egyptian god often depicted as a grey heron.",

    title: 'New Horizons',
    desc: ' ⚫ Launch: 2006 ⚫ Mission status: Active ⚫ NASA\'s New Horizons mission is exploring worlds at the outer edge of our solar system, including the dwarf planet Pluto and the mysterious Kuiper Belt, a vast region of icy objects in the outer solar system beyond Neptune. Launched in 2006 and, after a nearly decade-long journey into deep space, New Horizons performed a six-month flyby exploration of Pluto and its moons in summer 2015. It discovered four previously unknown moons of Pluto – Nix, Hydra, Styx and Kerberos – and provided new information about the surfaces of those bodies, their geology, interior makeup and atmospheres. This unique, first-time contact with the outer reaches of our solar system will help us understand how it was formed, and how Pluto and its moons interact with the other planets and distant objects in our solar system. Most of the planets in our solar system are either rocky (like Earth, Mars, Venus and Mercury) or gas giants (like Jupiter and Saturn). The two most distant planets, Uranus and Neptune, are classified as ice giants. But Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, are ""ice dwarfs."" This means they have solid surfaces but much of their mass is icy material. Astronomers believe that objects in the Kuiper Belt share this icy makeup. By getting a close-up look at these strange worlds, we can explore how ice dwarf planets and Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) have evolved over time. After a January 1, 2019, flyby of a KBO known as Ultima Thule, New Horizons is heading further into the Kuiper Belt to examine other ancient, icy mini-worlds. ⚫ Objectives: The goals of the New Horizons mission are to: Understand the formation of the Plutonian system and the formation of the early solar system. Study planets and other bodies that lie on the outer edges of our solar system and examine the following questions: What is Pluto\'s atmosphere made of, and how does it behave? What does Pluto\'s surface look like? Are there large geological structures? Does Charon have an atmosphere? How did the Kuiper Belt form, and what kinds of objects lie at its outer reaches?',

    title: 'Titan',
    desc: "Titan is the largest moon of Saturn, the second-largest in the Solar System and larger than any of the dwarf planets of the Solar System. It is the only moon known to have a dense atmosphere, and is the only known object in space other than Earth on which clear evidence of stable bodies of surface liquid has been found. Titan is one of the seven gravitationally rounded moons in orbit around Saturn, and the second most distant from Saturn of those seven. Frequently described as a planet-like moon, Titan is 50% larger (in diameter) than Earth's Moon and 80% more massive. It is the second-largest moon in the Solar System after Jupiter's moon Ganymede, and is larger than the planet Mercury, but only 40% as massive. Discovered in 1655 by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, Titan was the first known moon of Saturn, and the sixth known planetary satellite (after Earth's moon and the four Galilean moons of Jupiter). Titan orbits Saturn at 20 Saturn radii. From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees, and if it were visible through the moon's thick atmosphere, it would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky, in diameter, than the Moon from Earth, which subtends 0.48° of arc. Titan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material, which is likely differentiated into a rocky core surrounded by various layers of ice, including a crust of ice Ih and a subsurface layer of ammonia-rich liquid water. Much as with Venus before the Space Age, the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until the Cassini–Huygens mission in 2004 provided new information, including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan's polar regions. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found. The atmosphere of Titan is largely nitrogen; minor components lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and heavy organonitrogen haze. The climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan's methane cycle bears a striking similarity to Earth's water cycle, albeit at the much lower temperature of about 94 K (−179 °C; −290 °F). Due to these factors, Titan has been described as the most Earth-like celestial object in the Solar System. ⚫ Discovery: Titan was discovered on March 25, 1655, by the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens. Huygens was inspired by Galileo's discovery of Jupiter's four largest moons in 1610 and his improvements in telescope technology. Christiaan, with the help of his elder brother Constantijn Huygens Jr., began building telescopes around 1650 and discovered the first observed moon orbiting Saturn with one of the telescopes they built. It was the sixth moon ever discovered, after Earth's Moon and the Galilean moons of Jupiter. Titan is the largest and brightest moon of Saturn, and so is the easiest to observe of Saturn's moons with a standard optical telescope from Earth. ⚫ Naming: Huygens named his discovery Saturni Luna (or Luna Saturni, Latin for \"moon of Saturn\"), publishing in the 1655 tract De Saturni Luna Observatio Nova (A New Observation of Saturn's Moon). After Giovanni Domenico Cassini published his discoveries of four more moons of Saturn between 1673 and 1686, astronomers fell into the habit of referring to these and Titan as Saturn I through V (with Titan then in fourth position). Other early epithets for Titan include \"Saturn's ordinary satellite\". The International Astronomical Union officially numbers Titan as Saturn VI. The name Titan, and the names of all seven satellites of Saturn then known, came from John Herschel (son of William Herschel, discoverer of two other Saturnian moons, Mimas and Enceladus), in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations Made during the Years 1834, 5, 6, 7, 8, at the Cape of Good Hope. Numerous small moons have been discovered around Saturn since then. Saturnian moons are named after mythological giants. The name Titan comes from the Titans, a race of immortals in Greek mythology. ⚫ Orbit and rotation: Titan orbits Saturn once every 15 days and 22 hours. Like Earth's Moon and many of the satellites of the giant planets, its rotational period (its day) is identical to its orbital period; Titan is tidally locked in synchronous rotation with Saturn, and permanently shows one face to the planet. Longitudes on Titan are measured westward, starting from the meridian passing through this point. Its orbital eccentricity is 0.0288, and the orbital plane is inclined 0.348 degrees relative to the Saturnian equator, and hence also about a third of a degree off of the equatorial ring plane. Viewed from Earth, Titan reaches an angular distance of about 20 Saturn radii (just over 1,200,000 kilometers (750,000 mi)) from Saturn and subtends a disk 0.8 arcseconds in diameter. The small, irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion is locked in a 3:4 orbital resonance with Titan. Hyperion probably formed in a stable orbital island, whereas the massive Titan absorbed or ejected any other bodies that made close approaches. ⚫ Bulk characteristics: Titan is 5,149.46 kilometers (3,199.73 mi) in diameter, 1.06 times that of the planet Mercury, 1.48 that of the Moon, and 0.40 that of Earth. Titan is the tenth-largest object in the solar system, including the Sun. Before the arrival of Voyager 1 in 1980, Titan was thought to be slightly larger than Ganymede (diameter 5,262 kilometers (3,270 mi)) and thus the largest moon in the Solar System; this was an overestimation caused by Titan's dense, opaque atmosphere, with a haze layer 100-200 kilometres above its surface. This increases its apparent diameter. Titan's diameter and mass (and thus its density) are similar to those of the Jovian moons Ganymede and Callisto. Based on its bulk density of 1.88 g/cm3, Titan's composition is half ice and half rocky material. Though similar in composition to Dione and Enceladus, it is denser due to gravitational compression. It has a mass 1/4226 that of Saturn, making it the largest moon of the gas giants relative to the mass of its primary. It is second in terms of relative diameter of moons to a gas giant; Titan being 1/22.609 of Saturn's diameter, Triton is larger in diameter relative to Neptune at 1/18.092. Titan is probably partially differentiated into distinct layers with a 3,400-kilometer (2,100 mi) rocky center. This rocky center is believed to be surrounded by several layers composed of different crystalline forms of ice, and/or water. The exact structure depends heavily on the heat flux from within Titan itself, which is poorly constrained. The interior may still be hot enough for a liquid layer consisting of a \"magma\" composed of water and ammonia between the ice Ih crust and deeper ice layers made of high-pressure forms of ice. The heat flow from inside Titan may even be too high for high pressure ices to form, with the outermost layers instead consisting primarily of liquid water underneath a surface crust. The presence of ammonia allows water to remain liquid even at a temperature as low as 176 K (−97 °C) (for eutectic mixture with water). The Cassini probe discovered evidence for the layered structure in the form of natural extremely-low-frequency radio waves in Titan's atmosphere. Titan's surface is thought to be a poor reflector of extremely-low-frequency radio waves, so they may instead be reflecting off the liquid–ice boundary of a subsurface ocean. Surface features were observed by the Cassini spacecraft to systematically shift by up to 30 kilometers (19 mi) between October 2005 and May 2007, which suggests that the crust is decoupled from the interior, and provides additional evidence for an interior liquid layer. Further supporting evidence for a liquid layer and ice shell decoupled from the solid core comes from the way the gravity field varies as Titan orbits Saturn. Comparison of the gravity field with the RADAR-based topography observations also suggests that the ice shell may be substantially rigid. ⚫ Formation: The moons of Jupiter and Saturn are thought to have formed through co-accretion, a similar process to that believed to have formed the planets in the Solar System. As the young gas giants formed, they were surrounded by discs of material that gradually coalesced into moons. Whereas Jupiter possesses four large satellites in highly regular, planet-like orbits, Titan overwhelmingly dominates Saturn's system and possesses a high orbital eccentricity not immediately explained by co-accretion alone. A proposed model for the formation of Titan is that Saturn's system began with a group of moons similar to Jupiter's Galilean satellites, but that they were disrupted by a series of giant impacts, which would go on to form Titan. Saturn's mid-sized moons, such as Iapetus and Rhea, were formed from the debris of these collisions. Such a violent beginning would also explain Titan's orbital eccentricity. A 2014 analysis of Titan's atmospheric nitrogen suggested that it was possibly sourced from material similar to that found in the Oort cloud and not from sources present during the co-accretion of materials around Saturn.",

    title: 'Europa',
    desc: "Europa, or Jupiter II, is the smallest of the four Galilean moons orbiting Jupiter, and the sixth-closest to the planet of all the 95 known moons of Jupiter. It is also the sixth-largest moon in the Solar System. Europa was discovered independently by Simon Marius and Galileo Galilei and was named (by Marius) after Europa, the Phoenician mother of King Minos of Crete and lover of Zeus (the Greek equivalent of the Roman god Jupiter). Slightly smaller than Earth's Moon, Europa is made of silicate rock and has a water-ice crust and probably an iron–nickel core. It has a very thin atmosphere, composed primarily of oxygen. Its white-beige surface is striated by light tan cracks and streaks, but craters are relatively few. In addition to Earth-bound telescope observations, Europa has been examined by a succession of space-probe flybys, the first occurring in the early 1970s. In September 2022, the Juno spacecraft flew within about 320 km (200 miles) of Europa for a more recent close-up view. Europa has the smoothest surface of any known solid object in the Solar System. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath the surface, which could conceivably harbor extraterrestrial life. The predominant model suggests that heat from tidal flexing causes the ocean to remain liquid and drives ice movement similar to plate tectonics, absorbing chemicals from the surface into the ocean below. Sea salt from a subsurface ocean may be coating some geological features on Europa, suggesting that the ocean is interacting with the sea floor. This may be important in determining whether Europa could be habitable. In addition, the Hubble Space Telescope detected water vapor plumes similar to those observed on Saturn's moon Enceladus, which are thought to be caused by erupting cryogeysers. In May 2018, astronomers provided supporting evidence of water plume activity on Europa, based on an updated analysis of data obtained from the Galileo space probe, which orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003. Such plume activity could help researchers in a search for life from the subsurface Europan ocean without having to land on the moon. The Galileo mission, launched in 1989, provides the bulk of current data on Europa. No spacecraft has yet landed on Europa, although there have been several proposed exploration missions. The European Space Agency's Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer (JUICE) is a mission to Ganymede launched on April 14, 2023 that will include two flybys of Europa. NASA's Europa Clipper is expected to be launched in October 2024, with a complementary lander possible based on its findings. ⚫ Discovery: Europa, along with Jupiter's three other large moons, Io, Ganymede, and Callisto, was discovered by Galileo Galilei on 8 January 1610, and possibly independently by Simon Marius. The first reported observation of Io and Europa was made by Galileo on 7 January 1610 using a 20×-magnification refracting telescope at the University of Padua. However, in that observation, Galileo could not separate Io and Europa due to the low magnification of his telescope, so that the two were recorded as a single point of light. The following day, 8 January 1610 (used as the discovery date for Europa by the IAU), Io and Europa were seen for the first time as separate bodies during Galileo's observations of the Jupiter system. ⚫ Orbit and rotation: Europa orbits Jupiter in just over three and a half days, with an orbital radius of about 670,900 km. With an orbital eccentricity of only 0.009, the orbit itself is nearly circular, and the orbital inclination relative to Jupiter's equatorial plane is small, at 0.470°. Like its fellow Galilean satellites, Europa is tidally locked to Jupiter, with one hemisphere of Europa constantly facing Jupiter. Because of this, there is a sub-Jovian point on Europa's surface, from which Jupiter would appear to hang directly overhead. Europa's prime meridian is a line passing through this point. Research suggests that tidal locking may not be full, as a non-synchronous rotation has been proposed: Europa spins faster than it orbits, or at least did so in the past. This suggests an asymmetry in internal mass distribution and that a layer of subsurface liquid separates the icy crust from the rocky interior. The slight eccentricity of Europa's orbit, maintained by gravitational disturbances from the other Galileans, causes Europa's sub-Jovian point to oscillate around a mean position. As Europa comes slightly nearer to Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational attraction increases, causing Europa to elongate towards and away from it. As Europa moves slightly away from Jupiter, Jupiter's gravitational force decreases, causing Europa to relax back into a more spherical shape, and creating tides in its ocean. The orbital eccentricity of Europa is continuously pumped by its mean-motion resonance with Io. Thus, the tidal flexing kneads Europa's interior and gives it a source of heat, possibly allowing its ocean to stay liquid while driving subsurface geological processes. The ultimate source of this energy is Jupiter's rotation, which is tapped by Io through the tides it raises on Jupiter and is transferred to Europa and Ganymede by the orbital resonance. Analysis of the unique cracks lining Europa yielded evidence that it likely spun around a tilted axis at some point in time. If correct, this would explain many of Europa's features. Europa's immense network of crisscrossing cracks serves as a record of the stresses caused by massive tides in its global ocean. Europa's tilt could influence calculations of how much of its history is recorded in its frozen shell, how much heat is generated by tides in its ocean, and even how long the ocean has been liquid. Its ice layer must stretch to accommodate these changes. When there is too much stress, it cracks. A tilt in Europa's axis could suggest that its cracks may be much more recent than previously thought. The reason for this is that the direction of the spin pole may change by as much as a few degrees per day, completing one precession period over several months. A tilt could also affect estimates of the age of Europa's ocean. Tidal forces are thought to generate the heat that keeps Europa's ocean liquid, and a tilt in the spin axis would cause more heat to be generated by tidal forces. Such additional heat would have allowed the ocean to remain liquid for a longer time. However, it has not yet been determined when this hypothesized shift in the spin axis might have occurred. ⚫ Physical characteristics: Europa is slightly smaller than the Moon. At just over 3,100 kilometres (1,900 mi) in diameter, it is the sixth-largest moon and fifteenth-largest object in the Solar System. Though by a wide margin the least massive of the Galilean satellites, it is nonetheless more massive than all known moons in the Solar System smaller than itself combined. Its bulk density suggests that it is similar in composition to terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of silicate rock. ⚫ Composition: The Galileo orbiter found that Europa has a weak magnetic moment, which is induced by the varying part of the Jovian magnetic field. The field strength at the magnetic equator (about 120 nT) created by this magnetic moment is about one-sixth the strength of Ganymede's field and six times the value of Callisto's. The existence of the induced moment requires a layer of a highly electrically conductive material in Europa's interior. The most plausible candidate for this role is a large subsurface ocean of liquid saltwater. Since the Voyager spacecraft flew past Europa in 1979, scientists have worked to understand the composition of the reddish-brown material that coats fractures and other geologically youthful features on Europa's surface. Spectrographic evidence suggests that the darker, reddish streaks and features on Europa's surface may be rich in salts such as magnesium sulfate, deposited by evaporating water that emerged from within. Sulfuric acid hydrate is another possible explanation for the contaminant observed spectroscopically. In either case, because these materials are colorless or white when pure, some other material must also be present to account for the reddish color, and sulfur compounds are suspected. Another hypothesis for the colored regions is that they are composed of abiotic organic compounds collectively called tholins. The morphology of Europa's impact craters and ridges is suggestive of fluidized material welling up from the fractures where pyrolysis and radiolysis take place. In order to generate colored tholins on Europa, there must be a source of materials (carbon, nitrogen, and water) and a source of energy to make the reactions occur. Impurities in the water ice crust of Europa are presumed both to emerge from the interior as cryovolcanic events that resurface the body, and to accumulate from space as interplanetary dust. Tholins bring important astrobiological implications, as they may play a role in prebiotic chemistry and abiogenesis. The presence of sodium chloride in the internal ocean has been suggested by a 450 nm absorption feature, characteristic of irradiated NaCl crystals, that has been spotted in HST observations of the chaos regions, presumed to be areas of recent subsurface upwelling. The subterranean ocean of Europa contains carbon.",

    title: 'Valles Marineris',
    desc: 'Valles Marineris, Latin for Mariner Valleys, named after the Mariner 9 Mars orbiter of 1971–72 which discovered it, is a system of canyons that runs along the Martian surface east of the Tharsis region. At more than 4,000 km (2,500 mi) long, 200 km (120 mi) wide and up to 7 km (23,000 ft) deep, Valles Marineris is one of the largest canyons of the Solar System, surpassed in length only by the rift valleys of the mid-ocean ridge system of Earth. Valles Marineris is located along the equator of Mars, on the east side of the Tharsis Bulge, and stretches for nearly a quarter of the planet\'s circumference. The canyon system starts in the west with Noctis Labyrinthus; proceeding to the east are Tithonium and Ius chasmata, then Melas, Candor and Ophir chasmata, then Coprates Chasma, then Ganges, Capri and Eos chasmata; finally it empties into an outflow channel region containing chaotic terrain that ends in the basin of Chryse Planitia. It has been recently suggested that Valles Marineris is a large tectonic "crack" in the Martian crust. Most researchers agree that this formed as the crust thickened in the Tharsis region to the west, and was subsequently widened by erosion. Near the eastern flanks of the rift, there appear to be channels that may have been formed by water or carbon dioxide. It has also been proposed that Valles Marineris is a large channel formed by the erosion of lava flowing from the flank of Pavonis Mons. ⚫ Formation: The most agreed upon theory today is that Valles Marineris was formed by rift faults, later enlarged by erosion and collapsing of the rift walls, similar to how the East African Rift was formed. The formation of Valles Marineris is thought to be closely tied with the formation of the Tharsis Bulge. The Tharsis Bulge was formed from the Noachian to Late Hesperian period of Mars, in three stages. Topographic map of Valles Marineris with its associated outflow channels and their surroundings, based on MOLA altimetry data. The first stage consisted of a combination of volcanism and isostatic uplift; soon, however, the volcanism loaded the crust to a point at which the crust could no longer support the added weight of Tharsis, leading to widespread graben formation in the elevated regions of Tharsis. The second stage consisted of more volcanism and a loss of isostatic equilibrium; the source regions of the volcanism no longer resided underneath Tharsis, creating a very large load. Finally, the crust failed to hold up Tharsis and radial fractures formed, including at Valles Marineris. The third stage mainly consisted of more volcanism and asteroid impacts. The crust, having already reached its failure point, just stayed in place and younger volcanoes formed. Tharsis volcanism involved very low viscosity magma, forming shield volcanoes similar to those of the Hawaiian Island chain, but, because there is minor or no current active plate tectonics on Mars, the hotspot activity led to very long histories of repeated volcanic eruptions at the same spots, creating some of the largest volcanoes in the solar system, including the biggest, Olympus Mons. Landslides have left numerous deposits on the floor of Valles Marineris and contributed to widening it. Possible triggers of landslides are quakes caused by tectonic activity or impact events. Both types of events release seismic waves that accelerate the ground at and below the surface. Mars is much less tectonically active than Earth, and marsquakes are unlikely to have provided seismic waves of the required magnitude. Most sizable craters on Mars date to the Late Heavy Bombardment, 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago (the Noachian period), and are older than the landslide deposits in Valles Marineris. However, three craters (including the crater Oudemans) have been identified, on the basis of their proximity and later dates, as ones whose formation may have caused some of the landslides.',

    title: 'Asteroid Belt',
    desc: "The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, centered on the Sun and roughly spanning the space between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. It contains a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The identified objects are of many sizes, but much smaller than planets, and, on average, are about one million kilometers (or six hundred thousand miles) apart. This asteroid belt is also called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System. The asteroid belt is the smallest and innermost known circumstellar disc in the Solar System. Classes of small Solar System bodies in other regions are the near-Earth objects, the centaurs, the Kuiper belt objects, the scattered disc objects, the sednoids, and the Oort cloud objects. About 60% of the main belt mass is contained in the four largest asteroids: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea. The total mass of the asteroid belt is estimated to be 3% that of the Moon. Ceres, the only object in the asteroid belt large enough to be a dwarf planet, is about 950 km in diameter, whereas Vesta, Pallas, and Hygiea have mean diameters less than 600 km. The remaining bodies range down to the size of a dust particle. The asteroid material is so thinly distributed that numerous uncrewed spacecraft have traversed it without incident. Nonetheless, collisions between large asteroids occur and can produce an asteroid family, whose members have similar orbital characteristics and compositions. Individual asteroids within the belt are categorized by their spectra, with most falling into three basic groups: carbonaceous (C-type), silicate (S-type), and metal-rich (M-type). The asteroid belt formed from the primordial solar nebula as a group of planetesimals, the smaller precursors of the protoplanets. Between Mars and Jupiter, however, gravitational perturbations from Jupiter disrupted their accretion into a planet, imparting excess kinetic energy which shattered colliding planetesimals and most of the incipient protoplanets. As a result, 99.9% of the asteroid belt's original mass was lost in the first 100 million years of the Solar System's history. Some fragments eventually found their way into the inner Solar System, leading to meteorite impacts with the inner planets. Asteroid orbits continue to be appreciably perturbed whenever their period of revolution about the Sun forms an orbital resonance with Jupiter. At these orbital distances, a Kirkwood gap occurs as they are swept into other orbits. ⚫ Formation: In 1802, shortly after discovering Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments of a much larger planet that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, with this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before, while Odesan astronomer K. N. Savchenko suggested that Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta were escaped moons rather than fragments of the exploded planet. The large amount of energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of Earth's Moon, does not support these hypotheses. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. A modern hypothesis for the asteroid belt's creation relates to how, in general for the Solar System, planetary formation is thought to have occurred via a process comparable to the long-standing nebular hypothesis; a cloud of interstellar dust and gas collapsed under the influence of gravity to form a rotating disc of material that then conglomerated to form the Sun and planets. During the first few million years of the Solar System's history, an accretion process of sticky collisions caused the clumping of small particles, which gradually increased in size. Once the clumps reached sufficient mass, they could draw in other bodies through gravitational attraction and become planetesimals. This gravitational accretion led to the formation of the planets. Planetesimals within the region that would become the asteroid belt were strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity. Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object into a different orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other. In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of a planet. Instead, they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. During the early history of the Solar System, the asteroids melted to some degree, allowing elements within them to be partially or completely differentiated by mass. Some of the progenitor bodies may even have undergone periods of explosive volcanism and formed magma oceans. Because of the relatively small size of the bodies, though, the period of melting was necessarily brief compared to the much larger planets, and had generally ended about 4.5 billion years ago, in the first tens of millions of years of formation. In August 2007, a study of zircon crystals in an Antarctic meteorite believed to have originated from Vesta suggested that it, and by extension the rest of the asteroid belt, had formed rather quickly, within 10 million years of the Solar System's origin. ⚫ Composition: The present day belt consists primarily of three categories of asteroids: C-type carbonaceous asteroids, S-type silicate asteroids, and a hybrid group of X-type asteroids. The latter have featureless spectra, but they can be divided into three groups based on reflectivity, yielding the M-type metallic, P-type primitive, and E-type enstatite asteroids. Additional types have been found that do not fit within these primary classes. There is a compositional trend of asteroid types by increasing distance from the Sun, in the order of S, C, P, and the spectrally-featureless D-types. Carbonaceous asteroids, as their name suggests, are carbon-rich. They dominate the asteroid belt's outer regions, and are rare in the inner belt. Together they comprise over 75% of the visible asteroids. They are redder in hue than the other asteroids and have a very low albedo. Their surface compositions are similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. Chemically, their spectra match the primordial composition of the early Solar System, with the lighter elements and volatiles removed. S-type (silicate-rich) asteroids are more common toward the inner region of the belt, within 2.5 AU of the Sun. The spectra of their surfaces reveal the presence of silicates and some metal, but no significant carbonaceous compounds. This indicates that their materials have been significantly modified from their primordial composition, probably through melting and reformation. They have a relatively high albedo and form about 17% of the total asteroid population. M-type (metal-rich) asteroids are typically found in the middle of the main belt, and they make up much of the remainder of the total population. Their spectra resemble that of iron-nickel. Some are believed to have formed from the metallic cores of differentiated progenitor bodies that were disrupted through collision. However, some silicate compounds also can produce a similar appearance. For example, the large M-type asteroid 22 Kalliope does not appear to be primarily composed of metal. Within the asteroid belt, the number distribution of M-type asteroids peaks at a semimajor axis of about 2.7 AU. Whether all M-types are compositionally similar, or whether it is a label for several varieties which do not fit neatly into the main C and S classes is not yet clear. One mystery is the relative rarity of V-type (Vestoid) or basaltic asteroids in the asteroid belt. Theories of asteroid formation predict that objects the size of Vesta or larger should form crusts and mantles, which would be composed mainly of basaltic rock, resulting in more than half of all asteroids being composed either of basalt or olivine. However, observations suggest that 99% of the predicted basaltic material is missing. Until 2001, most basaltic bodies discovered in the asteroid belt were believed to originate from the asteroid Vesta (hence their name V-type), but the discovery of the asteroid 1459 Magnya revealed a slightly different chemical composition from the other basaltic asteroids discovered until then, suggesting a different origin. This hypothesis was reinforced by the further discovery in 2007 of two asteroids in the outer belt, 7472 Kumakiri and (10537) 1991 RY16, with a differing basaltic composition that could not have originated from Vesta. These latter two are the only V-type asteroids discovered in the outer belt to date. The temperature of the asteroid belt varies with the distance from the Sun. For dust particles within the belt, typical temperatures range from 200 K (−73 °C) at 2.2 AU down to 165 K (−108 °C) at 3.2 AU. However, due to rotation, the surface temperature of an asteroid can vary considerably as the sides are alternately exposed to solar radiation and then to the stellar background.",
